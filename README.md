# Reinforcement Learning with advice

Experiments with the criticality-based advice (CBA) method for RL.

Experiments with multiple versions of CBA: m-CBA, p-CBA

... in different environments: Atari Pong, Gridworld

... underlying advice strategy: uncertainty-based advice

... using different RL algorithms: bootstrapped DQN, Q-learning
